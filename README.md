## 🪄 Database Migration System

### Overview

The Virtual Sales Agent includes a robust database migration system that allows for schema evolution over time. This system tracks all schema changes, applies them in order, and ensures database consistency across environments.

### Features

- **Version Tracking**: Automatically manages migration version history
- **SQL-Based Migrations**: Define schema changes using familiar SQL syntax
- **Transactional Safety**: All migrations run within transactions for safety
- **Developer Tools**: Convenient scripts for migration creation and management

### Migration Management

#### Setting Up Migrations

Initialize the migration system with:

```bash
python setup_migrations.py
```

This creates the necessary directory structure and converts your existing schema into the initial migration.

#### Creating New Migrations

To create a new migration:

```bash
python create_migration.py add_product_ratings
```

This creates a new numbered migration file in `database/migrations/versions/` where you can define your schema changes:

```sql
-- Migration: add_product_ratings
-- Created: 2025-03-24 14:30:25

-- Write your migration SQL here
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN rating FLOAT DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN review_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### Applying Migrations

Migrations are automatically applied when the application starts. You can also apply them manually with:

```bash
python reset_database.py
```

This resets the database and applies all migrations in sequence.

### Migration Structure

Migrations are stored in SQL files with version numbers:

```
database/migrations/
└── versions/
    ├── 001_initial_schema.sql
    ├── 002_sample_migration.sql
    ├── 003_add_product_ratings.sql
    └── ...
```

The system tracks which migrations have been applied in the `schema_migrations` table, ensuring each migration runs only once.

### Benefits

- **Collaborative Development**: Multiple developers can make schema changes without conflicts
- **Deployment Safety**: Consistent schema across development, testing, and production
- **Version Control**: All database changes are tracked in version control
- **Rollback Capability**: Clear history of changes with ability to restore previous states
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting schema evolution history

### Best Practices

- Keep migrations small and focused on specific changes
- Always test migrations on development before applying to production
- Include both "up" (apply) and "down" (rollback) logic when possible
- Document complex migrations with comments
- Never modify existing migration files after they've been committed

For more information on database management, refer to the code documentation in the `database/migrations/` directory.

## 💬 Usage Examples

Here are some example interactions with the virtual sales agent:

### Product Search

```
User: I'm looking for a gaming mouse for big hands.
Agent: I'd be happy to help you find a gaming mouse suitable for larger hands! 
       Looking at our inventory, I would recommend the Logitech G604 LIGHTSPEED.

       It features:
       • Larger frame specifically designed for palm grip and larger hands
       • 15 programmable controls
       • Wireless with dual connectivity options
       • Extended battery life of up to 240 hours
       • Price: $99.99

       Would you like more information about this mouse or would you prefer to see other options?
```

### Product Comparison

```
User: What's the difference between the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S22?

Agent: Here's a comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S22:

Samsung Galaxy S21 ($799.99):
• 6.2" Dynamic AMOLED display
• Exynos 2100 processor
• 8GB RAM, 128GB storage
• 4000mAh battery
• Triple rear camera (12MP+12MP+64MP)
• 8K video recording

Samsung Galaxy S22 ($899.99):
• 6.1" Dynamic AMOLED 2X display (slightly smaller but improved quality)
• Newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor (better performance)
• 8GB RAM, 128GB storage (same)
• 3700mAh battery (slightly smaller) but with faster 45W charging
• Enhanced camera system with improved night mode and 3x optical zoom
• $100 price difference

The S22 offers better performance, improved camera capabilities especially in low light, and faster charging, but has a slightly smaller screen and battery. Would you like me to recommend one based on your specific needs?
