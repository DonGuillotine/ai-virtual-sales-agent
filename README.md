Here are some example interactions with the virtual sales agent:

### Product Search

```
User: I'm looking for a gaming mouse for big hands.
Agent: I'd be happy to help you find a gaming mouse suitable for larger hands! 
       Looking at our inventory, I would recommend the Logitech G604 LIGHTSPEED.

       It features:
       • Larger frame specifically designed for palm grip and larger hands
       • 15 programmable controls
       • Wireless with dual connectivity options
       • Extended battery life of up to 240 hours
       • Price: $99.99

       Would you like more information about this mouse or would you prefer to see other options?
```

### Product Comparison

```
User: What's the difference between the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S22?

Agent: Here's a comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S22:

Samsung Galaxy S21 ($799.99):
• 6.2" Dynamic AMOLED display
• Exynos 2100 processor
• 8GB RAM, 128GB storage
• 4000mAh battery
• Triple rear camera (12MP+12MP+64MP)
• 8K video recording

Samsung Galaxy S22 ($899.99):
• 6.1" Dynamic AMOLED 2X display (slightly smaller but improved quality)
• Newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor (better performance)
• 8GB RAM, 128GB storage (same)
• 3700mAh battery (slightly smaller) but with faster 45W charging
• Enhanced camera system with improved night mode and 3x optical zoom
• $100 price difference

The S22 offers better performance, improved camera capabilities especially in low light, and faster charging, but has a slightly smaller screen and battery. Would you like me to recommend one based on your specific needs?
